meditations is a simple todo list that builds on habit formation in order to encourage you to form long-term habits and
accomplish all your hopes and dreams.

It's a very minimalist program compared to complex time management systems. It leaves the structure up to you, but I've
found it to be a great help combined with [James Clear's](http://jamesclear.com) writings about habit formation. It
also serves as a sort of triage system: when your daily todo lists are ten items long, and you're not making visual
progress on your monthly goals, you know it may be time to scale back your grand designs on life. In this way it serves
as a very low-maintenance but objective log of your progress, particularly when you follow [bright-line
rules](http://jamesclear.com/bright-lines) on whether or not you've completed a task.

# Usage
