meditations is an application for tracking life progress that builds on habit formation and long term thinking.

It's fairly minimalist compared to complex time management systems; it leaves the structure of your day entirely up to
you, but it is a great way to get a much more objective, overarching view of how you are doing.

# Usage

    $ go build
    $ ./meditations --port [PORT] --database [PATH]
