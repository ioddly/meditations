** Editor functionality

*** TODO webpack-dev-server refreshing causes NoteRoute to fail with editor error
    This seems to be a bug in Slate itself -- I've tried stripping out all of my various extensions to a bare minimum component, but it is
    still not capable of hot refresh.

    Disabling refresh via // @refresh reset fixes this.

** 2020-11-22 Picking up
   Starting to tackle this again. Left off with a partially constructed backend. Immediate goal is to get to a point
   where it's usable for day to day editing. The bare minimum for that would be a persistent backend and some more
   basic editing functionality. Functionality like collections / tags can come later. 
   
   I guess an interesting thing to do would be -- use this application to recreate this orgmode document. It should
   be well within its purview. 

   But in any case, for today, let's work on hooking up the backend.

   That being said, it might be worthwhile to continue to have an ephemeral editor instance untethered from the
   backend. For experimentation, but also just for quick note taking.

   Scratch.

   Ok. Have it generating some queries from my schema. Now I need to set up an urql client probably, then query my
   actual backend. The other thing is I have some type duplication now between backend/frontend/shared. Question is,
   are GraphQL types expressive and appropriate enough for my editor? No -- I'll probably have to translate at some
   points between the loosely typed GraphQL / database stuff and the well-typed document format. The main two components
   that will interact with well-typed documents will be the thing on the backend that parses documents into relations
   e.g. backlinks, collection entries, and the editor itself. Otherwise it probably will just be passing them around?
   
   So, get the graphql stuff to shared as well.
   
** 2020-11-23 DX + database hookup
   Today working on improving development a little bit and hooking things up so we're actually talking to the database.
   
   Working on loading documents. How do you handle reloading a big toplevel query? Probably only want to show loading
   states once. After that you load-in with animations. Do you pass around the re-execute thing you got? Maybe.
   
   ---
   
   Got to the point where you can create backend docs from the sidebar. Next step should probably be actually saving
   documents automatically. Then from there you can start to make the actual backend functionality (collection linking,
   search etc).
   
   Another backend problem, how do you / can you rename things? @Run can be stored as an entry pointing at collection
   @Run, but if we ever want to rename Run the only option is to parse all docs and rename. Another option is to store
   the collection id, but then rendering docs requires a join. Do you basically send back some kind of lookup table
   along with docs? e.g. {"collections": {"collection-12345": "Run"}}

   That actually doesn't sound profoundly painful. When sending back a document initially, you do these joins
   (collections, backlinks, tags) etc. Then from there updates only need to be made when changing a link of some kind.

   What can I get done this week?
   - Saving and updating documents
   - Creating collections on the fly and making entries in them
   - Basic search -- search for a collection, pin a note to a collection search
   - Basic navigation (beyond giant folder of all documents ever)
   - Improve document editing

** 2020-11-24 Database hookup continues

   Alright so I can create documents from the sidebar. Now I need to load & render them, then figure out an
   update/auto-save scheme. Also need a scratch editor exempted from saving and loading (or just into memory).
   
   Once I have basic saving hooked up, what's interesting? Search maybe.
  
   So when saving, let's save every X seconds when there is input. Flush when user leaves the page or route.

** 2020-11-25 Database hookup continues

   Working on a useAutosave hook that handles managing the interval and making the actual call to save things.
