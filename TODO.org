* Habits
** DONE CalculateStats should switch intelligently on monthly and yearly tasks
** TODO Remove comments table, collapse to tasks
** TODO Collapsing
   Or some other way of reducing visual clutter with tasks that are frequently logged but otherwise uninteresting.
   Perhaps shift-click to register as completed and hide? Or shift-click to hide?
   Then just a checkmark at the top to show hidden tasks or not.
** TODO Reporting minute amounts over 60 should round down
** TODO Calculate and display average time
** DONE Copying and pasting comments doesn't seem to work. Probably because it messes with focus in some way.
** DONE Using ctrl-up in medium-editor reduces font size
** DONE Properly ignore tags for deleted entries. Deleting entries should also delete associated entry_tags.
** DONE Add search and/or filtering. This could also be used to select entries for export
** DONE Export in a nice, helpful way. Probably need to bring in some kind of modal.
  Exports should download to a text file or something like that.
** TODO Add a created-at date to bucket items (currently displays beginning of month)
** DONE Is the Bucket enough for long-term projects, or should there perhaps be some true kanban functionality?
** TODO Use overflow for daily tasks?
** TODO Adding to project lists should cause the flame to grow bigger immediately
** TODO It would be even better to just update things in place rather than using a modal. Some kind of unobtrusive
  textinput.
** TODO As before, navigation buttons should also be valid links so they can be opened in new tabs.
** TODO Export causes downloads on multiple tabs. Export does not work when served through nginx
* Journal
** DONE Month link is broken
** TODO Adding a new journal entry and navigating to it should change the URL appropriately
** TODO Add a named entry
** TODO Add a named entry from LinkTree navigation
** DONE Sidebar should reflect entry state.
** TODO LinkTree styling
** DONE Fix lists in journal entries
** TODO Fix poor formatting in some older entries
** DONE Fix synchronization
** TODO Add tags from navigation bar
* Overall
** TODO D3 visualization
** TODO Medium-editor: make it smaller, and add an HR option or something to more clearly visually separate things.
** TODO Replace the navbar with the date navigation element; generalize the date navigation element
** DONE Port to Bootstrap 4.6
** DONE Port from CoffeeScript to ES2015 or TypeScript
** DONE Simplify sync code by moving messaging stuff to sync.go
** DONE Remove jQuery if possible
** DONE Remove a bunch of unnecessary code.
** DONE Database cleanup on start
** DONE Clean up moment code. Just use string constants in common rather than special methods.
    Perhaps convert dates to moments when they are received.
** DONE Nice error messages
** DONE Nice loading indicators
** DONE Title updates
** TODO Client-side, server-side and behavioral tests
** TODO React performance optimization
** DONE Handle WebSocket disconnects gracefully
** TODO Octicon replacement. There's no need to include all the octicons when this app uses 10-15 of them. Medium-editor-tables will have to be modified.
** TODO Switching from habits to journal or back causes a "WebSocket connection failed" message to pop up on Firefox.
** DONE Use flexbox instead of bootstrap grid.

** TODO Time handling
    And OTOH, if you write a journal entry at 2:30 local time, you probably always want it to be
    reported as that, because you want to know when you wrote it, not when you wrote it adjusted
    for where you are now. 

* 0.1 roadmap
** DONE Write manual
** DONE Visual redesign
** TODO Journal search
** TODO Interactive timer
** TODO Built-in tutorial
** TODO Responsive interface
** TODO Windows & linux build
** TODO Redesign navbar (again)
** TODO Electron port
** DONE Refactor frontend code to be more organized
*** DONE window.prompt is unsupported
